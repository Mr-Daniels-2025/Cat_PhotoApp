# Cat_PhotoApp

This project is based on a lesson under the "Responsive Web Design" lesson offered by freeCodeCamp.org.

The goal is to Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App.

I demonstrated that HTML tags give a webpage its structure. Here, I used HTML tags to add photos, buttons, and other elements to this webpage.

In this course, I learned the most common HTML tags by building my own cat photo app.

NOTE:  This lesson was completed to 100%.
